# Iris Species Classification and Clustering - README

## Project Overview
This project involves both classification and clustering on the Iris dataset. The primary objective is to classify iris species based on sepal and petal dimensions, as well as to explore unsupervised clustering techniques.

---

### Key Features of the Dataset
- **Features**: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width
- **Target Variable**: Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

---

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Exploration
- Visualized relationships between features using scatter plots and pairplots.
- Identified clear separability between species based on petal dimensions.

### 2. Classification
- Models Used:
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Performance Evaluation:
  - Achieved ~97% accuracy using SVM.

### 3. Clustering
- **K-Means Clustering**:
  - Determined optimal clusters using the elbow method.
  - Compared clusters with true labels to evaluate accuracy.
